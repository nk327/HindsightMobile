# HindsightMobile
1) Takes a screenshot every 2 seconds (only of apps you choose)
2) Reads and embeds the text from each screenshot with OCR
3) Lets you chat with anything you've seen on your phone via a local LLM (my favorite: llama3.2 1B)

5. Run the application using `Run` > `Run 'app'` or the play button in Android Studio
    * If getting incompatible AGP version install the newest version of Android Studio
